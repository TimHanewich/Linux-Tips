# How to connect to Wifi in Ubuntu Server
[This page on Ubuntu's website](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/networkmanager/configure-wifi-connections) describes how we can connect to wifi from the command line... and the nice thing is, after doing this and rebooting, it auto-reconnects!

So, after doing this, you can reboot and SSH into it, completely headless (SSH comes pre-installed and pre-enabled on Ubuntu Server, unlike Debian/Debian Server).
