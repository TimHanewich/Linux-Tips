# Orange Pi 3 LTS
I own an [Orange Pi 3 LTS](https://www.amazon.com/Orange-Pi-Allwinner-Computer-Support/dp/B09TQZH4GJ). I'm not a fan of it, it is hard to use. Not much community support, not many out-of-the-box libraries. But I still can get it to work for basic server-related things...

This page is meant to serve as a directory of resources/tricks for Orange Pi 3 LTS.

The official Orange Pi 3 LTS page can be found [here](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/orange-pi-3-LTS.html), and official resources from the company can be found [here](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/service-and-support/Orange-pi-3-LTS.html).

At the bottom of the second page, they have a list of official images that can run on the OPi 3 LTS:

I recommend the Ubuntu images, as Ubuntu comes with a lot of pre-installed/OOTB software to make things easier (for example, easily connect to wifi, documented [here](../ubuntu-server-wifi/)). You can find the Ubuntu images in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KzyzyByev-fpZat7yvgYz1omOqFFqt1k), but I am also archiving them here just in case that page goes down:
